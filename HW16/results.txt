How the robot works:
1 slider was used to adjust the thresholding value to identify RGB.  
The Android CDC app sent the COM value to the PIC.
The PIC used the COM value to adjust the PWM outputs using a series of if/else if statements.  
For example, if the COM is low (on the left side of the screen), make the PWM controlling the right wheel
higher to make the robot turn left.
If the COM is an intermediate value (320), set both PWMs equal to each other.

On the hardware side, a weight was added towards the front of the robot to move the center of mass
and increase the normal force between the wheels and the ground, providing greater friction.
